In this report, I will describe the product I have first done research for,
and then developed during my Graduation Internship at Rythe Interactive.

During this process, I adhered to the Double Diamond @double-diamond design process model.

== Company

This graduation project is being done for the company Rythe Interactive.
Rythe is a very small startup company of just two employees, and an intern (me).

The product they are creating is the Rythe Game Engine, the aim of which is to be a modular yet performant game engine.
The modular nature makes it extra easy for companies to modify it to suit their own specific purposes,
without having to build an entirely new engine from scratch.

== Problem Definition

There are currently already multiple iterations of the Rythe Engine in existence.

The first version, Rythe Legacy, is so old that it still uses OpenGL.
OpenGL is bad for performance, due to the CPU usage required @vkguide-multithreading.
It can also not be properly multi-threaded, which is especially bad @khr-forum-multithreaded-rendering,
because one of the main goals of the engine is to make optimal use of *all* of the CPU and GPU, by making it as multi-threaded as possible.
The architecture of this version of the engine was too tightly integrated with OpenGL to be worth putting more effort into.

The first rewrite used more modern technologies, and had a dedicated renderer component called Rythe-LLRI, or "Rythe Low Level Rendering Interface".
It was a cross-platform GPU API abstraction, that was intended to be as low-level as possible to ensure maximum performance.
The LLRI is very old and was written before the Vulkan API had even properly released in 2016 @khronos-release-vulkan-1.0. It is also not finished.

Now, a second rewrite of the engine is being worked on, but it is still lacking a good rendering system.
Therefore, the LLRI component could also do with a rewrite, alongside the rest of the engine.

== Requirements and Constraints

The goal of the LLRI is to:
- Be portable to other GPU API's down the line (not necessarily immediately).
- Abstract away some implementation details, like initialization and placing barriers, that are more verbose and obtuse than they need to be,
  from the perspective of an engine user, who is implementing new graphics features into their game.
- Guarantee some safety checks that make it a bit harder for engineers to shoot themselves in the foot
  #footnote[Reference to the famouse quote _#quote("C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.")_ â€” #cite(<stroustrup-footguns>, form: "prose")],
  like ensuring that data is in the correct format and commands are sent in the correct order,
- Allow enough low level access to not restrict engineers from being able to design their own renderer architecture.
- Minimise overhead of the abstraction where possible, or at least move as much of it to
  compile-time or startup-time as possible.
- Allow Compute to be used, for even more control over the GPU, because Compute is often used in modern games,
  for dynamically generating data on the GPU.

=== Deliverable

At the end of the project, I will have a GitHub Repository with a few prototypes/experiments
with various GPU APIs and abstraction layers.
If there is time, I would also like to have a GitHub repository with a start of the actual LLRI2 library in it.

=== Indicators of Success

I'll have succeeded if I got the beginnings of a GPU API abstraction layer done.
Experimental prototypes with various GPU APIs and abstraction layers will be considered a success, too.
Those prototypes will show basic functionality needed for a rendering system,
such as rendering a spinning 3D model with a texture on it.

If I have gotten to the point where I have an initial prototype of the LLRI2 library itself,
I will verify and ensure that it is done enough by implementing the same as the prototypes,
but with the LLRI2 library instead.

== GPU APIs

//TODO: Collect more sources for this stuff.

To make a good and performant rendering system, we need to interface with the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

There are many GPU APIs, like OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, Metal, and most consoles have their own specific ones.
All of these are compatible with different operating systems and platforms.

*OpenGL* is generally the most compatible with all kinds of hardware, but also the oldest and clunkiest, and is considered deprecated by many, myself included.
For that reason, OpenGL will not be mentioned much in this report, as it cannot really hold a candle to these other, more modern APIs.

//TODO: This paragraph has got to be improved
*Vulkan* is a very low-level GPU API, by the Khronos Group, a consortium of organizations that focuses on graphics. @khronos-about\
Vulkan is known as the most verbose GPU API, which is often used as ammunition to ridicule it, but being verbose has many advantages.
It is much clearer about what it actually does, for example, and you have more control over what happens and when.
This means it allows for a lot of control and thus optimization, at the cost of development effort.
Vulkan is actually not exactly a GPU API, because it is more of a general-purpose Acceleration Device API.
GPUs are just one type of Acceleration Device.
However, for the purposes of this report, I will consider only the GPU aspects of Vulkan.

*DirectX* is for Windows and Xbox. In fact, the Xbox _only_ supports DirectX.
Windows itself does support more than just their own DirectX API, though.\
It is technically possible to run DirectX on Linux, through compatibility layers, like DXVK and vkd3d.
#footnote[For example, Valve makes use of them in their Proton software, which allows Windows games to run on Linux.]
However, it should be noted that these compatibility layers are not officially supported or endorsed by Microsoft, the developers of DirectX.

*Metal* is for Apple devices, which also don't (natively) support anything else.
#footnote[Technically, macOS does also support OpenGL, but only an old version (4.1 from 2011 @macos-opengl).
And the latest _normal_ OpenGL version is already old! (4.6 from 2017 @opengl46-release)]\
However, there is a very popular translation layer for running Vulkan on Apple devices, called MoltenVK.
MoltenVK is not officially supported by Apple, but it is part of the Khronos Vulkan Portability Initiative. @moltenvk-2017

PlayStation has two proprietary and "secret" APIs, called *GNM* and *GNMX*. @schertenleib-2013\
GNM is the low-level API, and GNMX is a higher-level wrapper around it. @leadbetter-2013\
Not much is publicly known about these APIs, because you need to sign an NDA to get access to the PlayStation Developer Kit.

Nintendo Switch also has a proprietary and "secret" API, called *NVN*.
This is the preferred API to use, but the Switch at least does _support_ Vulkan, too.
Not much is publicly known about this API, because you need to sign an NDA to get access to the Nintendo Switch Developer Kit.

#import "lib/03-api_compat_table.typ": api_compat_table
#figure(
	api_compat_table,
	caption: [An overview of Platform â†” API Compatibility]
) <api_compat_table>

As we can see in @api_compat_table, Vulkan is the most cross-platform of any of these APIs,
being supported on Windows, Linux, Android, and Nintendo Switch, with compatibility layers existing for Apple devices.

This is why I will be starting with Vulkan as the first GPU API that I will be abstracting for the LLRI2.

However, when making actual applications, it is inconvenient and highly inefficient
to keep rewriting all Vulkan boilerplate from scratch for each new project.
This is why we make an abstraction layer on top of Vulkan, so it can be reused across multiple projects.

In this report, I will detail my efforts at making (the beginnings of) such a Vulkan Abstraction Layer.

]

There already exist many GPU API abstraction layers. But, this is a good thing!
Because, in my experience, it is impossible to create an abstraction layer that is entirely unopinionated.

When making a big thing small, aspects of the big thing have to be dropped.

As such, depending on the opinions and preferences of the maker of the abstraction layer,
each abstraction layer will cut different aspects of the original API.
There can be no abstraction layer that keeps all aspects of the original API,
because then you would be right back at the original API.

There are many people who have gone before us in making abstraction layers,
so in this section, I will explore and research some of these GPU API abstraction layers that already exist.
Many of these abstraction layers use different wildily different programming styles (paradigms), so I have categorised them.
After that, I will compare them and pick one or a few to actually research practically, which I will do by prototyping with them.

I will be discussing the following paradigms:
Global State Machine, Pipelines and Passes (Mantle-descendants), Partial Abstractions, Rendergraph-based Abstractions, and Scenegraph-based Abstractions.
For each I will give a (small) description, list some already-existing implementations of it, and evalute its usefulness for this project.

After the prototyping, I will choose the paradigm to go ahead with for our own abstraction layer.


#pagebreak()
=== Global State Machine

State machines are a programming paradigm where there is some object that has a state,
upon which functions can be called that change the state of the object.
These objects are usually initialised with a pre-set state @state-pattern-nystrom.
They are very useful, but can get out of hand when the state starts encompassing too many things.
Or when the state is globally accessible, and can be changed from anywhere in the code @global-state-so @global-state-cneude.

Global State Machines are nevertheless a popular paradigm for GPU APIs.
It was especially common in APIs of the past, but is still used in some simpler abstractions today.
They often require relatively little code to get something up and running,
due to the initial state already being set up with default values.
They are very convenient for _small programs_, but can very quickly become unwieldy for larger programs.

There are two types of Global State Machine API: immediate-mode and buffer-paradigm.

Immediate mode entails that the programmer sends every tiny instruction to the GPU in many separate GPU calls.
This is *extremely* slow, because modern GPUs much prefer chewing through large datasets and instructions in one go,
rather than receiving one single instruction per call.

This is why the newer paradigm introduced buffers. Buffers are large sets of data that are copied to the GPU in one go.
The instructions of what to do with that data are usually still pretty small and separate calls, though.

This is what Pipelines and Passes APIs solved by also making the instructions one large dataset, instead of small and separate instructions.

OpenGL, a really old GPU API #footnote[The last release, 4.6, was in 2017, and it is not in development anymore. @opengl46-release],
and older versions of DirectX actually were global state machines already @opengl-concepts.
Modern GPU APIs have moved away from this kind of architecture, because they were extremely cumbersome to work with, and often very slow.

Modern GPU APIs also match the things that are actually happening on a hardware level more closely than these older APIs.

Despite the aforementioned cons, some people still like the paradigm of global state machine APIs.

Most of these do not support Compute, but only Graphics, because Compute is a more recent addition to GPU APIs.
Compute was added to OpenGL in version 4.3, which is famously not supported by MacOS, to the chagrin of many developers.

==== Existing implementations

Immediate-Mode paradigm API:
- OpenGL Legacy (1.0 up to, but not including, 3.0)
- Direct3D 7 and before
- raylib's #link("https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rlgl.h")[rlgl.h].
  Provides a pseudo-OpenGL 1.1 immediate-mode style API, overtop modern OpenGL, with some optimizations, like batching.
  Supports both Graphics and Compute.

Buffer-paradigm APIs:
- OpenGL Modern (3.0 and later)
- Direct3D 8 to 11 (12 is a Pipelines and Passes-paradigm API)
- #link("https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx")[bgfx]. A rendering library with many backends and supported platforms,
  but with some more features than just direct GPU access, like text rendering. Supports both Graphics and Compute.

==== Evaluation

These abstractions are too high-level for Rythe, and global state is difficult to work with and reason about.
Global state machines also don't have enough potential for optimization,
because it is also nigh-impossible to properly multi-thread, which is a very important aspect of the Rythe Engine.

#v(3em)
=== Pipelines and Passes (Mantle-descendants)

Pipelines and Passes are the two main concepts of "modern" GPU APIs.
Specifically, they are are APIs that encourage batching big instructions together.

"Pipelines" are set up beforehand (rarely at runtime), and contain a lot of static information that doesn't change every frame, like shaders.
Then during runtime instructions and data are encounded into "command buffers" that are combined into "passes" in one go.
Synchronization with the CPU is minimized and explicit, instead of implicit, like many other APIs do (especially older ones, and ones that aren't meant for optimization).

Back in 2016, AMD released an experimental new GPU API called Mantle.
This was the first Pipelines and Passes API.
AMD then donated it to the Khronos Group, who turned it into Vulkan, and continued developing it.
Khronos is also the main driving force for making it as cross-platform as it is.
In the meantime, Microsoft and Apple were also inspired by Mantle, and created DirectX 12 and Metal, respectively, based on it.

Pipelines and Passes are also the main concepts of Vulkan (and other modern GPU APIs) itself, so you could call these abstractions "flat abstractions".
With this I mean that these abstractions very closely mirror the original GPU API, except that they are simplified.
However, they do contain and use the same core principles, namely the Pipelines and Passes paradigm.

==== Existing implementations

- #link("https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU")[SDL3's GPU API]. A new GPU API that is meant to be a low-level abstraction of Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal,
  but not _too_ low-level, either, where you spend a lot of time writing meaningless boilerplate. It looked at what is actually commonly used in these APIs,
  and implemented only that. Supports both Graphics and Compute. It aims to run on as many devices as possible, even consoles.
  This comes at the cost of not supporting many modern GPU features, like ray tracing, mesh shaders, and bindless resources.
- #link("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API")[WebGPU]: WebGPU is officially a JavaScript API meant for web browsers,
  but there are multiple native implementations of it, like #link("https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu")[wgpu-native] and #link("https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn")[Dawn].
- #link("https://github.com/floooh/sokol")[Sokol]: A modular, but minimal application framework, of which the "gfx" component is also a "pipelines and passes" abstraction.
  Supports both Graphics and Compute.
  (Ironically enough, this one doesn't _actually_ abstract Vulkan, but _does_ abstract almost all other GPU APIs)
- Diligent Engine's #link("https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore")[Core]: A GPU Abstraction layer that supports many very platforms.
- #link("https://github.com/facebook/igl")[IGL]: A cross-platform GPU abstraction layer by Facebook, mostly developed for their Quest VR headsets.
  It is pretty new.
- #link("https://github.com/corporateshark/lightweightvk")[LightweightVK]: A "deeply refactored fork" of IGL, which specifically abstracts modern Vulkan,
  and only exposes modern features, like bindless resources, mesh shaders and ray tracing.
- #link("https://github.com/veldrid/veldrid")[Veldrid]. A GPU API abstraction layer specifically for C#sym.hash. Most other ones are either C or C++.
  For a pipelines and passes abstraction, it is relatively high-level.
  (I intend to specifically take inspiration from this one for our own abstraction, as it manages to keep things very nice and short.)
- RavEngine's #link("https://github.com/RavEngine/RGL")[Graphics Library]: A thin C++ GPU API abstraction layer, with many convenience features,
  like shader compilation and reflection, and a very modern syntax.
- #link("https://github.com/Devsh-Graphics-Programming/Nabla")[Nabla]: Abstracts only Vulkan: "a curated set of Vulkan extensions and features".
  Because Vulkan gets new features relatively often, developers often have to re-learn parts of Vulkan.
  This library aims to always use the latest features in the background, while keeping a consistent API for the user.
- #link("https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NVRHI")[NVRHI]: NVIDIA's own cross-platform GPU API abstraction layer.
  It does not support many platforms, though; only Windows and Linux, but it does expose quite a few modern GPU features, like ray tracing.

==== Evaluation

I have tried a few of these APIs in the past, namely Veldrid, WebGPU, and SDL3's GPU API.

Veldrid is quite high level already, but quite nice to work with, due to the relative lack of boilerplate.
Sadly, it has become unmaintained, but it can still serve as inspiration for our own abstraction.

WebGPU is almost a nice API, but due to some design decisions and internal politics, it is not as good as I would have liked.
Especially because it's officially only a JavaScript specification,
which means that the native implementations have to just do their best to resemble it.
This has not gone very well, and the various native implementations are not very consistent with each other.
It also prescribes a custom shader language, of which the syntax is very like the Rust programming language,
which is not very beloved at Rythe.

However, I really ended up liking SDL3's GPU API. The documentation is excellent, and it is incredibly pleasant to use.
It still allows for a lot of low-level access, while also being very user-friendly and cross-platform.
It achieves this by not just abstracting Vulkan, but also DirectX 12 and Metal (and console APIs, as well).

This the paradigm I'll go with for our own abstraction layer, as it is the most flexible, powerful, and efficient.


#pagebreak()
=== Partial Abstractions

The abstractions mentioned before abstract the _entire thing_, and (usually) don't allow access to the internals like the raw Vulkan API it is abstracting.

But these "partial abstractions" are libraries that abstract only _parts_ of the Vulkan API,
while still allowing direct access to the raw Vulkan API in other places.

You can use multiple of these together, for their different purposes.

These are also sometimes referred to as "helper libraries".

- #figure(link("https://github.com/zeux/volk")[Volk], kind: "link", supplement: "link")<volk>: Dynamically load Vulkan functions at startup-time, instead of linking with Vulkan at compile-time. It may be faster than loading them trough the driver.
  Many Vulkan examples use this library, because it is very small and easy to use. Many other helper libraries also optionally integrate with it.
- #figure(link("https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap")[vk-bootstrap], kind: "link", supplement: "link")<vkb>: Helps with the initialization of Vulkan, by providing a set of functions that set up the most common things.
- AMD's #figure(link("https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator")[Vulkan Memory Allocator], kind: "link", supplement: "link")<vma>: Abstracts away many parts of Vulkan's memory management,
  and provides a simple interface for allocating and freeing memory for specific tasks.

==== Evaluation

I have made a Vulkan program in the past that used no partial abstractions,
and while it was cool to see how it all works and a good learning experience,
it is unlikely to be necessary to do all that again.

So we might use one or multiple of the above in our own abstraction,
after I have conducted some experiments with them.

=== Other types of Abstractions

There are other types of abstractions that are not really relevant for this project, because they are too high-level,
but they are still interesting technologies that I want to mention.

- #link("https://github.com/martty/vuk")[vuk]: A render-graph-based abstraction layer for Vulkan.
- AMD's #link("https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RenderPipelineShaders")[Render Pipeline Shaders]: A render-graph-based abstraction layer for Vulkan and DirectX 12.
- #link("https://github.com/asc-community/VulkanAbstractionLayer")[Vulkan Abstraction Layer]: A render-graph-based abstraction layer for Vulkan.
- #link("https://github.com/vsg-dev/VulkanSceneGraph")[Vulkan Scene Graph]: A scenegraph-based abstraction layer for Vulkan.


#pagebreak()
== Final Selected Solution(s)

The abstraction will be a Pipelines and Passes paradigm API, in which I may use some already-existing partial abstractions.

The reasoning is that this paradigm is just by far the most flexible and powerful.

=== About C and C++

Most of the existing GPU APIs are published in C, because it's the most fundamental language that is still widely used,
and it is relatively easy to interface with from other languages.

However, the Rythe Engine is written in C++, which can easily use C libraries.
So the LLRI2 library will be written in C++, so it might be able to benefit from some C++ features,
like RAII, templates, and smart pointers,


#pagebreak()
= Research Questions

For this project I will be working on creating the (start for a)
rendering system for the new version of the Rythe Game Engine.
This product could serve as the base for the complete LLRI rewrite.

	How can I develop a good start for a flexible,\
	yet performant cross-platform GPU API abstraction?
_]
#v(1em)

== Sub-questions

As part of this research, there are a few sub-questions that also need to be answered:
- How do you properly benchmark an in-house (graphics) engine?
- What are further potential avenues for more optimisation?

#if show_tips_from_manual [
_Once you have selected the most promising idea or ideas, you can start working on the prototype(s). As
explained in the Design Thinking module in year 1, quartile 1, prototyping involves creating basic models

usable product by validating the ideas you have generated. If done correctly, prototyping will create useful
feedback that enables midflight corrections._

_Prototypes can be anything a user can interact with, such as sketches, storyboards, posters, handmade
gadgets, interactive applications, diagrams and frameworks, virtual models, videos, etc. Using a
combination of high-fidelity and low-fidelity prototypes during the design process will provide valuable
feedback that can be applied to make your design process iterative._

_Use your report to justify the choices you made regarding the combination of prototypes and the various
iterations you conducted._
]

At first, I had planned to make a few prototypes with different APIs and abstraction layers,
that all had a lot of features that were important to have in an abstraction layer.

I had planned to use the Vulkan prototypes as a base for our abstraction layer.
If I find the already-existing partial abstractions useful enough, I will use those in our abstraction.

However, making all those prototypes with all those features was taking very long, as I really should have expected.
So I decided to focus on just two prototypes: one with SDL3's GPU API, and one with Vulkan
(with partial abstractions, hereafter also referred to as "helper libraries").


== SDL3's GPU API Prototype

I started with this prototype, because it is the one I was most curious about at that time.
I had already used Vulkan in the past, so I wanted to first try something new that promised to be more user-friendly.

And it delivered on that promise; the API is very nice to use, and the function documentation is excellent.
The examples are also okay, though they do take some untangling,
if you want to follow them closely, because they pack a lot of functionality into one example.

There is sadly also no full guide, yet, like LearnOpenGL @learnopengl, Vulkan Tutorial @vulkan-tutorial, or VkGuide @vkguide.

Nevertheless, I managed to get a triangle on screen pretty quickly, after which I started adding more features.

With the two prototypes I have made, I can do performance testing,
to compare the performance of the different APIs and abstraction layers.

== Methodology

I will make both programs do exactly the same thing, so that I can compare them fairly.
After that, I will unlock the framerates of both programs, and create a pre-allocated array of a few thousand elements,
which I will fill with that frame's frametime, measured in nanoseconds.
At the end, once those arrays are filled, the array gets written out to a file, and the program will close.

Naturally, I will run both programs in Release mode, to allow the compiler to optimize it.
If there is time, I will also run them in Debug mode, to see how much the performance differs between the two modes,
and in a "Mixed mode", where all the dependencies are compiled in Release mode, but the program itself is compiled in Debug mode.

With those two files full of frametimes, I can then compare the two programs' performance, by graphing the data.
All the values will be displayed in microseconds (Âµs),
because nanoseconds are too small to be useful for this kind of data, and milliseconds (ms) are too large.

I will create a line plot and a histogram of all the frametimes, and calculate the following statistics:
- The average frametimes
- The standard deviation
- Highs (1%, 0.1%, 0.01%)
- Lows (1%, 0.1%, 0.01%)
- The frame-to-frame deviation of the frametimes //TODO

I will also graph the occurrences of each frametime, to see how many frames were rendered with which times.
This is useful to see the grouping of the frametimes, and to see if there are any outliers.

These plots will be made with the Python library Matplotlib, which I also used for a previous project,
so I can largely re-use the scripts I wrote for that project, with the help of a friend who is a data scientist #footnote[PhD student in the field of Astronomy].

== Performance Testing (Benchmarking)

Here are the results of the performance testing of the two prototypes I made.

There are three attempts, to ensure fair measurements in regards to run-to-run variations.

Attempt 001 is not included in this section, as its results were suspiciously out of balance.
You can read more about that in @wait-idle-debacle.

These were compiled with GCC 15.1.1, in Release Mode.\
They were run on Manjaro Linux Zetar 25.0.3 (XFCE Edition) with kernel version: 6.6.90-1-MANJARO.\
The hardware used was an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, 16GB of system RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU.\
The GPU Driver version was 570.144.\

I recommend that Rythe continue with the development of the LLRI2 library.
I propose they hire me to do so, as I have already done a lot of research and prototyping for it.

It should also be considered to use SDL3's GPU API as the base for the LLRI2 library,
and fork it to add the more modern GPU features that Rythe wants to support,
such as Bindless Textures and hardware raytracing.
If that happens, it should be considered whether to only use SDL3's Vulkan implementation,
or whether to keep supporting the other APIs that SDL3's GPU API supports, like DirectX 12 and Metal.
And it should also be considered whether to "upgrade" it to C++, because SDL3's GPU API is in C.

== Further Research

=== Bindless Textures

The concept of Bindless Textures should be looked into.

Bindless Textures are a way to use textures without having to bind them to a texture unit first.
This is less safe, but more performant.
Research should be done into whether it is possible to create an abstraction for Bindless Textures that is relatively safe.

It apparently has the potential to be _much_ faster than Bindful Textures, which is the current standard.
Even though Bindless Textures have already existed for a very long time (2009 at least), still not all hardware supports it.
Research should be done into which hardware supports it, and whether it is worth it to use Bindless Textures in the LLRI2 library.
And possibly _only_ Bindless Textures, if it is supported by all hardware that Rythe wants to support.

Bindless Textures were supported in OpenGL, and Vulkan also supports various Bindless techniques,
but they are, of course, more involved than OpenGL. @opengl-bindful-to-vulkan-bindless @bindless-vulkan

When comparing bindless OpenGL to bindful OpenGL, the speedup can be 7x, according to NVIDIA. @bindless-opengl @bindless-opengl-slides
I suspect such high performance gains won't be achievable with Vulkan,
but only because properly written bindful Vulkan is already faster than bindful OpenGL.

=== Other Abstraction Layers

It might also be worth looking into the other promising frameworks and abstractions I've found, like Diligent Engine, Nabla, and NVRHI.
They might provide interesting insights into how to structure the LLRI2 library.

= Discussion

#if show_tips_from_manual [
_In the discussion chapter, you are expected to critically reflect on your design process and solution._

_You can ask questions such as:_
- _how valid the research you conducted is_
- _how reliable the test results are_
- _the suitability of the methods used_
- _what went well and what did not go so well_
- _the value of the insights you presented to your client_
- _and most importantly, to what extent you solved the problem of the client or the user_
_Itâ€™s important to show a critical but fair view on these topics._

== Waiting for GPU Device Idle<wait-idle-debacle>

For the testing, Glyn and I decided to make the GPU APIs wait until the GPU Device is idle before measuring each frametime.
The idea there was that it would accurately measure both the CPU and GPU time it takes to render a single frame.
However, SDL's `SDL_WaitForGPUIdle(device)` function clearly does something else than Vulkan's `vkDeviceWaitIdle(device)`,
because the SDL GPU program was _significantly_ faster than the Vulkan program, as you can see in @att001_table, @att001_plot, and @att001_hist.

#import "Plots/Output/Attempt 001 - WaitDevice, IDE Open, Right after first compile/table.typ": table001
#figure(
	table001,
	caption: [Statistics from when the wait calls were included]
) <att001_table>

#figure(
	image("Plots/Output/Attempt 001 - WaitDevice, IDE Open, Right after first compile/plot.svg"),
	caption: [Line plot of the frametimes from when the wait calls were included]
) <att001_plot>

#figure(
	image("Plots/Output/Attempt 001 - WaitDevice, IDE Open, Right after first compile/hist.svg"),
	caption: [Histogram of the frametimes from when the wait calls were included]
) <att001_hist>

Without those two wait calls, they were about the same speed.
Hence, I removed those wait calls again from both programs for the actual performance testing.

Due to many circumstances, both personal and external,
I did not manage to get as much done as I would have liked to,
so the scope of this project had to be reduced halfway through.

I should have expected that the prototyping would take longer than I had initially thought.
I had hoped to have been able to start on the LLRI2 library itself, but I did not manage to get that far.

Even so, I have learned a great deal during this project, and I am very proud of the work I have done.
Both the prototypes and the research.

So on the whole, I am still very happy with the results of this project.
